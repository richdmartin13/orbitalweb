{{< faq "What happens if I go over the allotted hours in my plan?" >}}
If you go over your hours, don't worry! We'll let you know when you're running short and when a project is about to reach overtime. If you end up running over, we'll bill you at $50 per hour unless otherwise agreed upon, in writing, beforehand.

Orbital Web is a service intended especially for those looking to start a serious project and those who are interested in giving back. Therefore, we are happy to offer discount codes for students and nonprofits upon request, depending on availability.

{{< faq "Is there an as-needed option instead of subscribing?" >}}
Orbital Web's mission is to provide ongoing and specialized support to our clients, and we encourage you to enroll in a plan in order to get the best experience. However, we are willing to do work on an as-needed basis at $50 per hour.

{{< faq "Any refunds?" >}}
If you are dissatisfied with our services, we can refund you for your unused portion of your monthly subscription if requested. To calculate your refund, we use the rate of $35 per hour of work subtracted from your monthly contribution. If work is done on an as-needed basis, we are unable to offer refunds for our services.
